# Wayland Setup

Wayland compositors block app-level global key capture and input simulation by design.
Voquill handles this with compositor-level keybindings and kernel-level input simulation.

## Prerequisites

### ydotool (required for text pasting)

Voquill uses `ydotool` to simulate Ctrl+V after placing transcribed text on the clipboard.
ydotool works on all Wayland compositors (GNOME, Sway, Hyprland, etc.) by writing directly
to `/dev/uinput` at the kernel level, bypassing Wayland's input restrictions.

**Install:**

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install ydotool

# Fedora / RHEL
sudo dnf install ydotool

# openSUSE
sudo zypper install ydotool
```

**Grant your user access to /dev/uinput:**

The uinput device must be readable/writable by your user. Two approaches:

*Quick (non-persistent):*

```bash
sudo chmod 666 /dev/uinput
```

*Persistent (survives reboot):*

```bash
# Add your user to the input group
sudo usermod -aG input $USER

# Create a udev rule so /dev/uinput is group-accessible
echo 'KERNEL=="uinput", GROUP="input", MODE="0660"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-uinput.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

Log out and back in for the group change to take effect.

**Enable the daemon (optional):**

ydotool works without the daemon on versions < 1.0 (with a "ydotoold backend unavailable" warning
and slightly higher latency). On >= 1.0, the daemon is recommended:

```bash
# ydotool >= 1.0
sudo systemctl enable --now ydotoold

# ydotool < 1.0 (no systemd service — daemon is optional)
# If you want lower latency: sudo ydotoold &
```

To check your version: `dpkg -l ydotool` (deb) or `rpm -q ydotool` (rpm)

**Verify it works:**

```bash
# Open a text editor, click into it, then run:
ydotool type "hello"
```

If "hello" appears in the editor, ydotool is working.

**Known issues:**

- ydotool 0.1.x uses `modifier+key` syntax (e.g. `ctrl+v`). Version 1.0+ uses keycode
  press/release syntax (e.g. `29:1 47:1 47:0 29:0`). Voquill uses the 0.1.x syntax which
  is supported across both versions.
- Without `/dev/uinput` access, ydotool will fail with `failed to open uinput device`.
  Make sure the permissions are set as described above.

### wtype (fallback for Sway/Hyprland)

On Sway and Hyprland, `wtype` is an alternative that uses the `virtual-keyboard-unstable-v1`
Wayland protocol. Voquill bundles wtype in production builds. For development, install it separately:

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install wtype

# Fedora / RHEL
sudo dnf install wtype

# openSUSE
sudo zypper install wtype
```

Note: wtype does **not** work on GNOME. GNOME does not implement the virtual-keyboard
protocol, so wtype will fail with "Compositor does not support the virtual keyboard protocol".
Use ydotool on GNOME instead.

## Hotkey registration

### How it works

1. Voquill starts a local HTTP bridge server on a random port at launch.
2. The port is written to `<app_config_dir>/bridge-server.json`.
3. A bundled trigger script (`trigger-hotkey.sh`) is deployed to the config dir.
4. Compositor keybindings call the trigger script, which POSTs to the bridge server.
5. The bridge server emits a Tauri event that the TypeScript layer handles.

### Automatic sync

When you configure hotkeys in Voquill's settings on Linux, the app automatically registers them with your compositor:

- **GNOME**: Registers via `gsettings` custom keybindings (dconf paths prefixed `voquill-`).
- **Sway**: Writes `~/.config/sway/voquill-hotkeys` and reloads.
- **Hyprland**: Writes `~/.config/hypr/voquill-hotkeys.conf` and reloads.

Old bindings are cleaned up automatically on each sync.

### One-time setup for Sway/Hyprland

Voquill manages a dedicated include file for your hotkeys, but you need to source it once.

**Sway** — add to `~/.config/sway/config`:

```
include ~/.config/sway/voquill-hotkeys
```

Then reload: `swaymsg reload`

**Hyprland** — add to `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`:

```
source = ~/.config/hypr/voquill-hotkeys.conf
```

Then reload: `hyprctl reload`

**GNOME** — no manual setup needed.

## Text pasting

Voquill pastes transcribed text by:

1. Saving the current clipboard contents
2. Setting the clipboard to the transcribed text (via `arboard`, no external tools needed)
3. Simulating a paste keystroke (Ctrl+V or Ctrl+Shift+V for terminals)
4. Restoring the previous clipboard contents after a short delay

The keystroke simulation tries these tools in order:

1. **ydotool** — works on all compositors via `/dev/uinput` (recommended)
2. **wtype** — works on Sway/Hyprland via virtual-keyboard protocol (bundled in production)
3. **wtype text** — types the text directly as a last resort (no clipboard)

If no keystroke simulation tool is available, pasting will fail. Install ydotool as described above.

## Manual trigger (development/debugging)

Use the deployed trigger script directly:

```bash
~/.config/com.voquill.desktop/trigger-hotkey.sh dictate
~/.config/com.voquill.desktop/trigger-hotkey.sh agent-dictate
~/.config/com.voquill.desktop/trigger-hotkey.sh cancel-transcription
```

## Bridge server details

The bridge server accepts `POST /hotkey/<action-name>` on `127.0.0.1`.

- `200 OK` — hotkey triggered successfully
- `404 Not Found` — unknown path
- `405 Method Not Allowed` — non-POST request

The port file is at:
- Dev: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/com.voquill.desktop.local/bridge-server.json`
- Prod: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/com.voquill.desktop/bridge-server.json`
